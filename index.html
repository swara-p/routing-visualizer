  <p><h4>
    Breadth First Search: <a href="./src/algorithms/bfs/bfs.html"> BFS </a><br>
  </h4> 
   Starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level</p>
  <p>
    <h4>
      Depth First Search: <a href="./src/algorithms/dfs/dfs.html"> DFS </a><br>
    </h4>
    Starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking</p>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4> 
      A* Algorithm : <a href="./src/algorithms/a-star/a-star.html"> A-star </a><br>
    </h4>
     An informed search algorithm, formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4> 
      Bellman Ford : <a href="./src/algorithms/bellman-ford/bellman-ford.html"> Bellman-Ford </a><br>
    </h4>
     Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph, proceeds by relaxation, in which approximations to the correct distance are replaced by better ones until they eventually reach the solution
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4> 
      Dijkstra Algorithm :<a href="./src/algorithms/dijkstra/dijkstra.html"> Dijkstra </a><br>
    </h4>
     Finds the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in a weighted graph by creating a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex, the source, to all other points in the graph
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4> 
      Floyd Warshall : <a href="./src/algorithms/floyd-warshall/floyd-warshall.html"> Floyd-Warshall </a><br>
    </h4>
     Finds shortest paths in a directed weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles) by comparing all possible paths through the graph between each pair of vertices
